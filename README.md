## NHS GP Practices (GPS) and Primary Care Networks (PCN)

>>> Still a work in progress...

This project aims to rework [this PowerBI dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNjQxMTI5NTEtYzlkNi00MzljLWE0OGItNGVjM2QwNjAzZGQ0IiwidCI6IjUwZjYwNzFmLWJiZmUtNDAxYS04ODAzLTY3Mzc0OGU2MjllMiIsImMiOjh9) using instead the open source [R]() programming language and the [Shiny framework](). The working app can be found [here]().

Data are collected monthly from this [public repository](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/patients-registered-at-a-gp-practice)

Maps related to:
 - Lower Layer Super Output Area (LSOA)
 - Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG)
 - Sustainability and Trasformation Partnership (STP) 

can be found in [this R package]().
